%% Amazing tag line that makes HR managers want to hire you immediately.\\The tag line is aligned with the bottom of the picture to the right, so if you have\\multiple lines it fills the space to your name from the bottom. You might want to\\introduce manual line breaks to make this look nicer then simply filling up the lines.

        establishing standards for the benchmark, including
        convergence criterion, and coordinating between a number
        of different groups from both the US and Europe.}

      {Aarhus University, Denmark}
      {PhD in Physics}
      {My PhD project was about simulating dynamics of
        molecules in strong laser fields. I worked with a low-level
        programming language (fortran) to create efficient programs for
        solving computationally intensive problems. I then collected and
        analysed results from these programs, and compared the results to
        approximate theories, in order to assess in which regimes those
        theories work well.  }
